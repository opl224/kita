## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft Lavender (#E6E6FA) to create a calming, approachable atmosphere, in contrast with the dark scheme.
- Background color: Very Dark Gray (#1A1A1A) for a modern and focused user experience. It complements the neumorphism design by providing depth and contrast.
- Accent color: Pale Violet (#D8BFD8) for interactive elements. The lighter color adds subtle contrast, without breaking the harmony of the violet color story.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, with its geometric and fashionable look, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, for modern readability.
- Use clean, minimalist icons suitable for a neumorphic style to enhance the user interface, ensuring they are easily recognizable and match the app's overall aesthetic.
- Implement a neumorphic design with soft shadows and inner shadows on UI elements to give them a 'lifted' or extruded appearance, enhancing the tactile feel of the interface.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and interactions, like a gentle fade or slide, to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience without being distracting.
